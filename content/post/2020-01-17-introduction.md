Hi there! I am a masters student at the University of Nevada, Reno looking at the ecological drivers of mule deer movement in the Mojave Desert using contemporary statistical methods and GPS collars.

# My Background

Previously, I was a USGS crew lead and technician on a long-term upland waterfowl nesting study in Suisun Marsh in California. I studied nest survival, duckling movement, survival, and brood pond use, and the interactions between skunks and raccoon interactions with nesting waterfowl.

While receiving my B.S. in Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University I was a technician for Casey Setash, a current Ph.D candidate at CSU, on her masters project looking at Cinnamon Teal breeding and population dynamics. This kicked off my interest in waterfowl and contemporary statistical methods used in the wildlife field.

After graduating, I was a technician on a long-term USGS study looking at plague interactions between black-tailed prairie dogs and plague in Badlands National Park, with a small component looking at plague in mouse and vole populations. This study was linked to federal management of prairie dogs and directly linked to black-footed ferret conservation in the park and surrounding national grasslands.

Today, I am in Dr. Perry Williams' quantitative ecology lab at UNR. We have developed a movement modeling working group with members from several different departments that are interested in modeling GPS telemetry data.
